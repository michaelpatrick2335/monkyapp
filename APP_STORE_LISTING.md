## Description (4000 char max)

```
Meet Monky — your pocket-sized meditation buddy.

Monky helps you build a real meditation habit with short, friendly sessions you'll actually finish. No 45-minute lectures, no incense-and-incantation vibes. Just simple breathwork, guided sits, and a journal that grows with you.

WHAT'S INSIDE

• Guided meditations from 1 to 20 minutes — quick resets when you need them, deeper sits when you have the time
• Breathwork exercises (box breathing, 4-7-8, coherent breathing) with calming on-screen guides
• Meditation journal — capture how you felt before and after each session, watch patterns emerge
• Streak tracking that's gentle, not guilt-inducing
• Calm jungle aesthetic — no harsh whites, no screaming notifications

WHO IT'S FOR

• Beginners who downloaded three meditation apps and quit all of them
• People who need 5 minutes of calm between meetings
• Anyone tired of subscription apps that hide everything behind a $99/year paywall
• Yogis, athletes, and night-owls who want a wind-down ritual

HOW IT WORKS

Open the app, pick a session, breathe. After, jot a note in your journal. That's it. Monky learns what works for you and suggests sessions that match your mood and schedule.

## Keywords (100 char max, comma-separated, no spaces after commas)
```
meditation,mindfulness,calm,breathwork,sleep,anxiety,focus,zen,journal,relax,stress,breathe,monky
```

**Strategy:** Mix of high-volume terms (meditation, calm, sleep, anxiety) + your brand (monky) + practice-specific (breathwork, journal, zen). Don't repeat words from your app name/subtitle — Apple indexes those automatically.

*(Health & Fitness has more meditation users than Lifestyle. Don't pick Education or Medical — too crowded / regulated)*

---

## Age Rating
**4+** (no objectionable content)

Apple will ask you a questionnaire — answer **None** to all questions (no violence, no profanity, no gambling, no unrestricted web access since we use a managed in-app browser).

## Screenshots (REQUIRED — 6.7" iPhone, 6.5" iPhone, 5.5" iPhone)

You need **at minimum 3 screenshots per device size**, but Apple recommends 5–10.

I'll generate these for you after you confirm the TestFlight build looks good on your phone — we'll take real screenshots from your device and dress them up with marketing copy. Standard sizes:
- **6.9" (iPhone 16 Pro Max):** 1320 × 2868 pixels
- **6.5" (iPhone 11 Pro Max):** 1242 × 2688 pixels
- **5.5" (iPhone 8 Plus):** 1242 × 2208 pixels — Apple allows you to skip this if you also provide 6.5"

**Screenshot concepts** (we'll design 5):
1. Splash screen — jungle scene with "Breathe in. Level out. Level up."
2. Today's meditation — guided session in progress with breathing circle
3. Meditation journal — collapsible entries with mood tracking
4. Library of sessions — categories like Focus, Sleep, Stress
5. Streak / stats screen — celebrating consistency
